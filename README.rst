django-richtemplates -- basic Richfaces port for Django projects
================================================================

`django-richtemplates`_ is a set of templates (surprise!), template tags,
media files providing presentation layer similar to what Richfaces library
offers for J2EE developers - not outstanding but still nice looking and
elegant.

We wanted to have ability to prototype Django_ projects/applications
with some basic set of templates and thats why `django-richtemplates`_
was created. We use it for our company's intranet applications but it
can be also easily used for example projects in other Django_ pluggable
applications.
